"Big data" is data that becomes large enough that it cannot be processed using conventional methods. Creators of web search engines were among the first to confront this problem. Today, social networks, mobile phones, sensors and science contribute to petabytes of data created daily.

To meet the challenge of processing such large data sets, Google created MapReduce. Google's work and Yahoo's creation of the Hadoop MapReduce implementation has spawned an ecosystem of big data processing tools.

As MapReduce has grown in popularity, a stack for big data systems has emerged, comprising layers of Storage, MapReduce and Query (SMAQ). SMAQ systems are typically open source, distributed, and run on commodity hardware.
